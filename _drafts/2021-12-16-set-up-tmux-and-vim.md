I have been learning code (primarily learning C) recently, and below is the log of how I set up tmux and vim as the environment.

# Tmux
Installation with Homebrew

```shell
brew install tmux
```

Configuration  
I used [samoshkin](https://github.com/samoshkin)'s configuration.  
[samoshkin/tmux-config](https://github.com/samoshkin/tmux-config)  
Read the Readme file about his keybindings and how to add your custom configuration.

# Vim
Vim is pre-installed on macos. 
About the configuration, I used [amix](https://github.com/amix)'s configuration.  
[amix/vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc)
